### Getting Started

This project is using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) which allows you to scaffold and run sketches.

Install the CLI tool globally `npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g`

To start a sketch run `npm start <sketch_filename.js>`. This will start a development server with features such as live-reloading, export, etc. For more info, see [Installing and Using canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

For example, to run the `500-lines.js` sketch you would run `npm start sketches/500-lines.js`
